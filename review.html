            <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-gray-300 space-y-6">
                <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">Core Concept</h3>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        The game's central mechanic revolves around a deadly game of chance where two test subjects must consume pills with unknown effects. Each pill could either provide beneficial effects or deliver devastating side effects that bring you closer to elimination. This creates an incredibly tense atmosphere where every decision feels like it could be your last.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-300 mb-3">Strategic Elements</h3>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        What sets Pill Roulette apart from pure chance-based games is its strategic depth. Players must carefully manage their tolerance levels, utilize various items strategically, and read their opponent's behavior. The game rewards both calculated risks and psychological warfare, making each match feel unique and engaging.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        The pacing is expertly crafted to build tension gradually. Each round escalates the stakes, and the uncertainty of pill effects creates a constant state of anxiety. The developers have successfully captured the essence of what made games like Buckshot Roulette so compelling while adding their own unique pharmaceutical twist.
